To view the store as a customer, type 'node customerView.js'.

Using the command line interface, AmazonNode can display item information stored in a MySQL database as a table.

Using an item id as a key identifier, you can chose which item to purchase and how much.

AmazonNode checks with the SQL database for every transaction to ensure that purchase quantities cannot exceed stock quantity.
